# Further Work

### Diagram Features
- Add option to include the call parameters' values (not just their names) in the diagrams
- Bug fixes required:
  - Add option to include return values (not just their types) in the diagrams
    - This requires solving the error described in the README, and it will enable us to get rid of the `LogContext`.
  - Make the tests run again
- Maybe: Add styling options to the diagrams

### Meta
- Simplify the usage process
- Make the plugin compatible with more Kotlin and Gradle versions
- Publish plugin and annotations to public Maven
- Create an IntelliJ plugin
